# Race-in-Voting-Lines
Over one hundred and sixty million Americans voted in the 2020 presidential election, setting a record number of ballots cast and the highest voter turnout rate since 1900. While the majority of votes were cast prior to Election Day, over fifty million Americans stood in line on November 3 in order to cast their ballot and participate in electing the next President of the United States. However, each of those citizens had vividly different voting experiences on Election Day - with some hardly waiting at all and others waiting over an hour.  In Pennsylvania, one of the most competitive states during the 2020 presidential election, voters in competitive counties were forced to spend “three to four hours” waiting in line just to exercise their civic right. However, voting times differ by more factors than just location and gender. Perhaps most importantly, voting times differ by race, creating important public policy implications about racial differences and the role they play in the election process.
